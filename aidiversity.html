                <h1>AI Advertising and the Simulation of Diversity</h1>
                <h2>Opinion | Patrick Feeney</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) is everywhere. What was once a quaint experimental technology 
                    has seemingly become the elephant in every room. Gen AI is well on its way to becoming a reliable and affordable 
                    alternative to traditional creative work, and whether we like it or not, AI advertising could become the default 
                    in the years to come. Before we get there, it's time to discuss 'AI diversity' and the responsibilities that come
                     with a technology that promises limitless generative choices. After all, when anyone can generate diversity, why 
                     should they bother with the real thing?
        </p>
    </article>
    <div class="body">
        <h1>Creativity Condondrum</h1>
        <p>The negative impacts of poor representation are clear, it can lead to stereotypes and bigotry, causing serious harm to marginalised groups. 
            But it can sometimes feel like the benefits of positive representation are misunderstood. Is representation meant to give us a warm, fuzzy 
            feeling, or should it reflect the genuine liberation and empowerment of oppressed groups?
            The creative industry isn't well positioned to address these questions, 50% of UK workers in creative fields come from high socio-economic 
            backgrounds (Social Mobility Commission, link) and in the US, creative occupations are 24% less racially and ethnically diverse than other 
            fields (CVSuite™, link). While this dynamic is shifting, many marginalised groups are still struggling to get their foot in the door. So, 
            what happens if Gen AI becomes the norm in advertising? AI can certainly simulate diversity, but it does nothing to address why more diversity 
            is needed in the first place. So, when a marketing campaign uses AI depictions of diverse groups without actually involving or compensating 
            them, do they have a responsibility to those communities? What does responsibility even look like?</p>

            <h1>Is The Diversity In The Room With Us?</h1>
            <p>
                This year, Coca-Cola’s Christmas ad was a little different, although at first glance it might be difficult to pinpoint why. 
                It features a familiar cast of happy customers, joyful tunes, and squeaky clean American omptimism, set against a snow-topped 
                backdrop. But the actors in this advert were never paid, in fact they never existed in the first place. This year Coca-Cola went 
                all-in on Gen AI, collaborating with AI studios Secret Level, Silverside AI and The Wild Card to generate an advertisement, as 
                opposed to filming it (Campaign, link). The public reaction has been mixed at best, verging somewhere between humour and existential
                 dread (Forbes, link). Many found the footage to be strange and confusing, tipping towards the uncanny valley in parts. And while 
                 there’s a debate to be had about the fidelity of the ad, I’m more concerned about the characters it depicts.
                 <br><br>
                Coca-Cola’s ad features a diverse cast of characters — young and old — many of the shots depicting people of colour. At 
                face value, this is a great choice. Showcasing the world as it is, allowing people to feel connected and understood, to 
                feel they are part of a whole. These are tangible benefits of inclusive advertising and they shouldn’t be ignored. But 
                when you can’t ask your actors for consent, when you can’t pay them for using their likeness, where do you draw the line
                 between appreciation and appropriation? To use an example closer to home — if a campaign generates queerness without 
                 actually including queer stakeholders, the trade off becomes difficult to rationalise. The least fortunate members of 
                 the queer community don’t need rainbow billboards, they need housing, support and freedom from violence. Without even 
                 the tenuous draw of knowing a queer person got paid – somewhere, at some point, the exercise begins to feel like cultural 
                 extraction, or even theft.
                 <br><br>
                When corporations employ certain demographics for advertising, it’s not just a transaction between individual actors and 
                marketing teams. When you employ a marginalised actor you’re also paying for a type of social currency, the right to
                 association. Marginalised individuals are often reduced to representations of the whole, reluctantly positioned as 
                 spokespeople for their communities. While this dynamic is wholly unfair, these types of biases exist at a subconscious
                  level – to a greater or lesser degree we are all influenced by them. So audiences could be forgiven when interpreting 
                  Coca-Cola’s advert as a communal endorsement, as a license to buy their products. But in the absence of real actors, 
                  have they paid fairly for this endorsement? This transaction isn’t just about currency, organisations might earn the 
                  right to align themselves with marginalised groups in a variety of ways. A homeless charity has earned the right to 
                  represent homelessness in a responsible manner, because these representations seek to benefit the same people they 
                  depict. From community investment to diversity behind the scenes, organisations using AI imagery need to find ways 
                  to settle the imbalance this technology has created — but communties should decide what that looks like, and when 
                  to push back.

                So, What Now?
            </h1>
            <p>
                As AI-generated content becomes increasingly prevalent, we need to set clear ethical standards on use. If audiences 
                perceive AI outputs as real (consciously or subconsciously) then the use of these images should adhere to the same 
                moral standards as actual imagery, including fair representation and consent. AI should be viewed as a public resource 
                that carries key responsibilities, not as a magic wand that can circumvent communities and cut down on costs.
                <br><br>
                Championing diversity at all stages of the AI life-cycle, not just in outputs, can mitigate some of these concerns. 
                Diversity among AI engineers & computer scientists has been shown to increase the likelihood that AI bias is identified 
                and addressed (AI and Ethics, link), and building up diverse voices in the creative industries will help to ensure AI 
                outputs are authored by the same communities they depict.
                <br><br>
                Creating rules on the fair use of AI imagery is also vital to reduce harm and ensure self-regulation doesn’t lead to
                 inconsistent standards across the industry. This should include content credentials, disclaimers, copyright flagging,
                  fair representation and community consent. If a creative team lacks the relevant cultural understanding to depict a 
                  community with integrity, they should involve community stakeholders and advocates, hire real-life actors and models,
                   or simply pass the project to someone else. These rules shouldn’t be best practice, they should be standard practice.

                An Unclear Future
            </h1>
            <p>
            We can’t turn back the clock on AI, and we can’t reasonably expect organisations to hold off on the deployment of these technologies.
             However, understanding the dangers of AI generated diversity and setting clear guidelines can help us to utilise these tools in a way
              that gives agency to marginalised people instead of exploiting them.
<br><br>
            All that being said, it still begs the question — good representation or bad representation — can we truly find liberation at the bottom of a banner ad?
